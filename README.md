[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)    [![Open Source Love](https://badges.frapsoft.com/os/v1/open-source.svg?v=102)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)  [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://github.com/iampawan/Flutter-UI-Kit/blob/master/licence.txt)

Foodly is my project in Flutter to see what can I do with the Flutter framework in UI designing. This is made with the help of the Sketch, and all code is written in Dart. All widgets are separated to keep clean code, and you can find all the code in the [/lib] folder.

I hope that this project will help someone with learning or searching for some new widgets for your project.
This project will be updated for long, as I will have time for it.

If I helped you in any way, or love this project, you can always support me.
